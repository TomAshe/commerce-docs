![Products listing in Drupal Commerce Kickstart 2](../../images/products-intro.png)

<p>The product listing in Commerce Kickstart 2 has been specifically honed to work with Store Managers that use the Product Display and Product Variations as described in the most common scenario. The view itself that you're seeing above is created with <a href="https://drupal.org/project/commerce_vbo_views">Commerce Views Bulk Operations</a> and <a href="https://drupal.org/project/views_megarow">Views Mega Row</a> for the extra fancy parts.</p>
