## Overview

The [Profile module] is a contributed Drupal module that is required by Drupal Commerce yet maintained separately from the core Drupal Commerce module. When you manage your Drupal Commerce site using [Composer](../../../getting-started/#using-composer), the *Profile* module will be automatically added to your project.

*Profiles* are fieldable entities that represent a set of user information. The Drupal Commerce *Order* module provides one specific profile type, called the *Customer* profile. *Customer* profiles are used to collect customer information necessary for billing, payment, and shipping.

### Relationship to user accounts
*User accounts* are also fieldable entities that can be used to capture customer information. However, only a single instance of this data will exist, and it is not revisionable. Therefore, user accounts are best used for information that is likely to stay fixed for customers, like gender or date of birth. This information isn't likely to change on a per-order basis. In contrast, users can have multiple *profiles*, each with a distinct set of information. Each *Customer* profile has a single address and can optionally include other information like phone number or contact name.

Every profile belongs to a single user account, and if a user account is deleted, then all of its profiles are also deleted. Within Drupal Commerce, *copies* of customer profiles are assigned to orders so that they cannot be deleted by customers. Customers cannot access these profiles, and they are only deleted if their parent orders are deleted.

### Address book
The collection of all *Commerce customer* profiles owned by a customer is called his *Address book* and can be managed as part of his User account information. If multiple Commerce customer profile types are created, then they will be organized into separate groups within the customer's address book. For each profile type, there is one *default* profile per user.

For example, this customer named *Betty Smith* has her home address as her *default* customer profile and a second address that can be optionally selected for her payment/billing/shipping information during checkout. An additional "Account information" profile type has been created which may serve some other purpose.

![Address book](../../images/profile-overview-1.png)

### Profiles in the checkout process
In Drupal Commerce, each order has a *Billing profile*, which is set during the checkout process. By default, customers are asked for billing information right after they either log in or (optionally) choose to continue as a guest. The *Billing information* checkout pane appears as part of the *Order information* step.

If the Drupal Commerce *Payment* module is enabled, the *Payment information* checkout pane is used instead of the *Billing information* pane. These checkout panes allow the customer to set the *Billing profile* for the order. If the payment gateway for an available payment method allows checkout without billing information, then it is possible to allow customers to check out without setting a billing profile for the order.

Here is an example of the *Order Information* step, in which the default *Customer* profile form is presented to the customer. When more than one customer profile is available, the "Select an address" element is provided. Since the *Payment* module is enabled for this example site, the profile is labeled as *Payment information* rather than *Billing information*.

![Address book](../../images/profile-overview-2.png)

#### Shipping profiles
If the [Commerce Shipping module] is installed, then a *Shipping Information* pane will also be available to collect the *Shipping profile* for the order. Any *customer* profile type can be used for both *billing* and *shipping* profiles. Using a single bundle for both billing and shipping information is generally a best practice for many sites and solutions. This includes Amazon, Shopify, BigCommerce, Spree, etc. 

However, some merchants may require different fields for billing vs. shipping. For those merchants,  shipment types can  be configured to use a different customer profile type. For example, here a "Shipping profile" profile type has been created and assigned to the Default shipment type:

![Address book](../../images/profile-overview-3.png)

## Profile Configuration

This section describes how you can use *Profiles* to capture and store information about your customers. In a default Drupal Commerce installation, the *Customer* profile type is provided for you. You can customize this *Customer* profile type to suit your needs and/or create additional profile types.

Access the administrative page for the *Customer* profile type and any others you create at `/admin/config/people/profiles`.

![Profile type configuration](../../images/profile-config-1.png)

### Customer profile fields
By default, profiles do not have any visible/editable fields; however, the Customer profile type includes an [Address](../addresses) field. Each Customer profile has a single address. You can customize the Address field that's used by the Customer profile at `/admin/config/people/profile-types/manage/customer/fields/profile.customer.address`. If the Commerce Tax module is installed, a "Tax number" field will also be added to the Customer profile type.

You can add custom fields to a profile using its *Manage fields* administrative page.  As an example, let's add a *Contact phone* field to our *Customer* profile type.

!!! example "*Contact phone* field"
    **Add the *contact phone* field**

    1. If the Drupal core [Telephone module] is not already installed, navigate to the *Extend* administrative page and install it: `/admin/modules`. (Alternatively, you could just use a text field.)
    2. Navigate to the *Manage fields* administrative page for the *Customer* profile type and click the *Add field* button.
    3. Select *Telephone number* as the field type.
    4. Enter *Contact phone* for the field label.
    5. Click the *Save and continue* button.

    ![Add contact phone field](../../images/profile-config-2.png)

    **Configure the *contact phone* field**

    6. On the *Field settings* page, leave the *Allowed number of values* set to 1.
    7. Click the *Save field settings* button.
    8. On the *settings* administrative page for *Contact phone*, select the *This is a private field* setting. Private profile fields are visible only to the owner of the profile and administrative users.
    9. Click the *Save settings* button.

    ![Configure contact phone field](../../images/profile-config-3.png)

    Next, you can use the *Manage form display* and *Manage display* administration pages for the profile to customize how the new field appears on data entry forms and in a customer's *Address book*. In the "Custom display settings", there are two additional form modes, Billing and Shipping, that can be enabled. If enabled, these form modes will be used whenever profile data entry forms are rendered during checkout and on the order admin edit page.

    ![Profile form modes](../../images/profile-config-6.png)

#### Adding fields to the customer profile vs. creating new profile types
The *customer* profile should contain all the billing information needed to process an order. If you have physical products and use the *Commerce shipping* module, then *customer* profiles can also be used for the shipping information associated with orders. For simpler commerce sites, especially those that are B2C, the *address* field may be all you need for the *customer* profile. For additional information, you could create a separate profile type to manage information about your customer like name and phone number. With this architecture, your customers would only enter need to enter their contact information once, for that separate profile type. In contrast, if you added the contact name and phone number fields to the *customer* profile, your customers would need to repeatedly enter that information for every billing and shipping address added.

For other commerce sites, your customers may actually be purchasing agents who order on behalf of a number of end users. In that case, you might need a set of additional fields associated with *each* billing and shipping address, such as contact email, contact name, contact phone, a note field, reference to a customer organization, reference to an assigned sales representative, etc. So, you would add each of these fields to your *customer* profile type. Your customers would have the flexiblity to enter completely different sets of data for each of their *customer* profiles. Ultimately, you'll need to decide what information needs to be captured on a per-order basis vs. what customer information you need apart from that billing- and shipping-specific data.

### Create a profile type
To create a new profile type:
1. Navigate to the *Profile types* administrative page at `/admin/config/people/profile-types`.
2. Click the *Add profile type* button.
3. Enter the name of the profile type for the *Label*. You can use the default settings for all other options, for now.
4. Click the *Save* button.

![Profile type creation](../../images/profile-config-4.png)

#### Profile type configuration options
**Label**

This is the name of the profile type. Change the label to change how it's displayed to customers.

**Description**

The description field is only used for administrative purposes. It is displayed in the *Profile types* listing at `/admin/config/people/profiles`. If your store will have many different profile types, entering a description for each can be helpful for profile management.

**Include in user registration form**

By default, the *Customer* profile type is included in the user registration form. If this option is enabled for a profile type, then its data entry form will be embedded at the end of the new user registration form. In this example, *Contact phone* has been added to the *Customer profile* profile type, so it also appears on the registration form.

**Allow multiple profiles**

This option is enabled for the *Customer* profile type, to allow customers to create and save multiple addresses in their [*Address book*](#address-book). If a user should only have a single set of data for a profile type, leave this option unselected. For example, if you create a *Contact information* profile type, you may want to have only one set of contact information per user.

 **Allowed roles**

By default, there are no roles selected for the *Customer* profile type, which means that all users can have this profile type. If you allow customers to check out anonymously (i.e., "guest checkout"), then you need to allow *all* users to have *customer* profiles. Every order requires a *customer* profile for its *billing information* field. For other profile types, you may want to limit their usage to only certain, selected roles.

#### Create a new revision when a profile is modified
Profiles are revisionable. Select this option to force a profile entity to be saved as a new revision whenever the profile is updated. This setting is normally not necessary for profiles used by Drupal Commerce since copies of profiles are saved to individual orders.

## Profile Management

In this section, we'll look at profile management topics, including permissions and access control, managing profiles on behalf of customers, and options for importing and exporting profiles.

### Profile access and permissions
**The *private field* setting**

In the [Contact phone example in the Profile configuration documentation](../profiles/#customer-profile-fields), we specified that our custom *contact phone* field should be a *private field*. If a profile field is set as private, then only the owner of the profile and administrative users with the *Administer profile entities* (`administer profile`) permission will be able to access the field.

#### Profile permissions
The profile module provides some general administraive permissions as well as a set of permissions specific to each profile type. On the *Permissions* administrative page, at `/admin/people/permissions`, you'll find profile-related permissions in the *Field UI* and *Profile* sections.

***Field UI* permissions**

- *Profile*: Administer display
- *Profile*: Administer fields
- *Profile*: Administer form display

These permissions should only be granted to users with administrative access to the site, typically users that are site builders or developers.

***Profile* permissions**

- Access the profile entities overview page
- Administer profile types
- Administer profiles
- View any profiles
- View own profiles
- View own unpublished profiles
- And a set of permissions for each profile type:
 - Create profile entities
 - Delete any profile
 - Delete own profile entities
 - Update any profile
 - Update own profile entities
 - View any profile
 - View own profile


 Typically, you will want to allow your *Authenticated Users* (customers) to create profile entities and delete/update/view their own *Customer* profile entities. The rest of the permissions are more appropriate for administrative users.

### Field permissions module
If you need to limit access to certain *fields* for the *customer* profile or any other type of profile, you may be able to utilize display and form view modes to display/hide specific profile fields. If you need more sophisticated access control, the [Field permissions] contrib module can provide that functionality. For example, suppose each of your customers is assigned to a specific regional sales representative. You would like customers to be able to *view* their sales representatives, but only administrative users should be allowed to make sales representative assignments. Also, you want to include the *sales representative* field with your order data so that it can be tracked in sales reports. So, we want this field to be part of the *Customer* profile.

#### Customization example: *sales representative* field
1. Add and install the *Field permissions* module. (See the [Extending documentation](../../../installation/#extending) for instructions.)
2. Add a *Sales representative* field to your *customer* profile type using the same approach we used above for the [*contact phone* field](#customer-profile-fields).
3. Select `Reference > User` for the field type. We could create a new [Taxonomy] for our *sales representative* information, but for this example, let's just assume that we'll create a [User account] for each of our sales representatives.

![Sales representative field creation](../../images/profile-management-1.png)

4. On the *Field settings* administrative page, the default settings are fine.
5. On the *settings* administrative page for the *Sales representative* field, enable *Custom permissions*.
6. For the *Authenticated user* role, enable only the *View anyone's value for field field_sales_representative* permission.

![Sales representative field creation](../../images/profile-management-2.png)

Now, customers will be able to view their sales representatives but not select their own.

### Manage profiles on behalf of customers
When you view the *Profiles* listing page at `/admin/people/profiles`, you'll see operations links that allow you to *Edit* and *Delete* profiles, but there's no way to add new profiles or efficiently search for existing profiles. Using out-of-the-box functionality, the best way to manage customer profiles is to access them via the main *People* listing page at `/admin/people`. Here, you can search by a variety of criteria, including name or email.

![People administrative listing](../../images/profile-management-3.png)

Once a customer account has been located, you can access his or her profiles from the *Edit* administrative page. You'll see a tab at the top of the page for each of your profile types. Here we see tabs for three profile types: *Contact information*, *Address book* (for *Customer* profiles), and *My custom profile type*. You can manage profiles on behalf of customers via these tabs.

![Manage customer profiles](../../images/profile-overview-1.png)

#### Customize the labels for customer profile tabs
The label for the *Customer* profile tab is *Address book*. It has been customized by the Drupal Commerce *Order* module. You can customize labels for any profile type by implementing `hook_local_tasks_alter()` in a custom module, like this:

```php
function mymodule_order_local_tasks_alter(&$definitions) {
  $id = 'entity.profile.user_profile_form:profile.type.my_profile_type';
  if (isset($definitions[$id])) {
    $definitions[$id]['title'] = t('My custom label');
  }
}
```

#### Use Views to customize the *Profiles* listing page
If your administrative users will frequently manage profiles on behalf of customers, you may want to use Drupal Views to customize the Profiles listing page, located at `/admin/people/profiles`. If you are unfamiliar with using Views in Drupal, you can read about [Creating Listings with Views], in the Drupal 8 User Guide.

**Example: View of profiles**
To start, we'll create a View with a page that has the same title and path as the existing *Profiles* administrative listing page:

![Create profiles view](../../images/profile-management-5.png)

To configure, we'll add fields and for the *Page Settings*, and we'll set the *Access* to `Permission: Access the profile entities overview page`. Additionally, we'd want to set *Sortable* table fields and add exposed *Filters* to help administrative users search the list more easily.

![Configure profiles view](../../images/profile-management-6.png)

**Bulk update options**
To allow administrative users to perform bulk operations on profiles, add the *Bulk update* field. The *Profile* module provides three bulk update options:
* Delete profile
* Publish profile
* Unpublish profile

If you are interested in creating additional [Action plugins] with custom code, the [Create an action for custom mass updates with Drupal 8], article is a good introduction to the topic.

### Importing profiles
For site builders, the [Commerce Feeds module] is a solution for importing profiles; unfortunately, it has not yet been fully ported into Drupal 8. If you are comfortable writing custom code for importing profiles, the [Commerce Migrate module] is a good place to start. There is a version for Drupal 8, [documentation], and an explanation of the differences between using Feeds vs. using Migrate for importing profiles and other commerce data.

### Exporting profiles
You can use the [Views data export module] to provide product export functionality. If you are unfamiliar with using Views in Drupal, start by reading about [Creating Listings with Views], in the Drupal 8 User Guide. Also, the [Importing and exporting documentation for Products](../../products/product-management/#exporting-products) includes an example of using Views data export for exporting products. The same approach can be used for exporting profiles.

## Code recipes

If you want to write custom code to programatically create or manage profiles, you can use these code recipes as a starting point.

     */
    $profile_type = \Drupal\profile\Entity\ProfileType::create([
    'id' => 'my_custom_profile_type',
    'label' => 'My custom profile type',
    'description' => 'A brief, administrative description for my custom profile type',
    'registration' => TRUE,
    'multiple' => TRUE,
    'roles' => ['authenticated', 'administrator'],
    'weight' => 10,
    'use_revisions' => TRUE,
    ]);
    $profile_type->save();

    // Add a custom field to a profile type.
    $field_storage = \Drupal\field\Entity\FieldStorageConfig::create([
    'field_name' => 'profile_fullname',
    'entity_type' => 'profile',
    'type' => 'text',
    ]);
    $field_storage->save();

    $custom_field = \Drupal\field\Entity\FieldConfig::create([
    'field_storage' => $field_storage,
    'bundle' => 'my_custom_profile_type',
    'label' => 'Full name',
    ]);
    $custom_field->save();

    // Make the custom field private.
    $custom_field->setThirdPartySetting('profile', 'profile_private', TRUE);
    $custom_field->save();
    ```

!!! example "Creating profiles"
    ```php
    // Create a new, active profile for a user.
    $user = user_load_by_mail('customer@example.com');
    $profile = \Drupal\profile\Entity\Profile::create([
    'type' => 'customer',
    'uid' => $user->id(),
    'status' => TRUE,
    'address' => [
        'country_code' => 'US',
        'postal_code' => '53177',
        'locality' => 'Milwaukee',
        'address_line1' => 'Pabst Blue Ribbon Dr',
        'administrative_area' => 'WI',
        'given_name' => 'Frederick',
        'family_name' => 'Pabst',
    ],
    ]);
    $profile->save();

    // Create an anonymous customer profile.
    $anonymous_profile = \Drupal\profile\Entity\Profile::create(['type' => 'customer']);
    $anonymous_profile->save();
    ```

**Load profiles**

!!! example "Loading profile types"
    ```php
    // Loading is based off of the primary identifier [String] that was defined when creating it.
    $profile_type = \Drupal\profile\Entity\ProfileType::load('my_custom_profile_type');
    ```

!!! example  "Loading profiles"
    ```php
    $user = user_load_by_mail('customer@example.com');

    // Get profile storage to use ProfileStorage methods.
    $profile_storage = \Drupal::entityTypeManager()->getStorage('profile');

    // Load an inactive customer profile for a user.
    $customer_profile = $profile_storage->loadByUser($user, 'customer', FALSE);

    // Load an active customer profile for a user.
    $customer_profile = $profile_storage->loadByUser($user, 'customer');

    // Load a specific profile.
    $profile_id = $customer_profile->id();
    $profile = $profile_storage->load($profile_id);

    // Load all profiles for user.
    $profiles = $profile_storage->loadByProperties(['uid' => $user->id()]);

    // Load all active customer profiles for a user.
    $customer_profiles = $profile_storage->loadMultipleByUser($user, 'customer');

    // Load all inactive customer profiles for a user.
    $customer_profiles = $profile_storage->loadMultipleByUser($user, 'customer', FALSE);

    // Load default customer profile for a user.
    $default_profile = $profile_storage->loadDefaultByUser($user, 'customer');
    ```

**Implement:**

!!! example "ProfileLabelSubscriber"
    The default label for a profile is the name of the profile type followed by its unique id. For example: "Customer profile #10". In the *Commerce Order* module, Drupal Commerce uses the `ProfileLabelSubscriber` event subscriber to set the customer profile label to the first address line.

    In this example, we assume that a *Nickname* field, `field_nickname` has been added to our *Customer* profile type and we want to use a profile's *Nickname* for the profile label whenever a *Nickname* has been entered. We give our event subscriber a lower priority `-100` so that it will run *after* the the event subscriber in the *Commerce Order* module.
    ```php
    <?php

    namespace Drupal\mymodule\EventSubscriber;

    use Drupal\profile\Event\ProfileLabelEvent;
    use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface;

    class ProfileLabelSubscriber implements EventSubscriberInterface {

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public static function getSubscribedEvents() {
        $events = [
        'profile.label' => ['onLabel', -100],
        ];
        return $events;
    }

    /**
     * Sets the customer profile label to the nickname if it exists, first address line otherwise.
     *
     * @param \Drupal\profile\Event\ProfileLabelEvent $event
     *   The profile label event.
     */
    public function onLabel(ProfileLabelEvent $event) {
        /** @var \Drupal\profile\Entity\ProfileInterface $order */
        $profile = $event->getProfile();
        if ($profile->bundle() == 'customer' && !$profile->address->isEmpty()) {
        if (!empty($nickname = $profile->get('field_nickname')->value)) {
            $event->setLabel($nickname);
        }
        else {
            $event->setLabel($profile->address->address_line1);
        }
        }
    }

    }
    ```

    Don't forget to add the event subscriber to your module's `services.yml` file and rebuild caches.
    ```php
    services:
    mymodule.profile_label_subscriber:
        class: Drupal\mymodule\EventSubscriber\ProfileLabelSubscriber
        arguments: ['@entity_type.manager']
        tags:
        - { name: event_subscriber }
    ```

!!! example "Altering profile inline forms"
    Checkout panes and billing and shipping profile widgets use inline forms to render profile forms using specific form displays. These forms can be altered using the `hook_commerce_inline_form_alter` and `hook_commerce_inline_form_PLUGIN_ID_alter` hooks. For example, the Commerce shipping module implements the plugin-id specific version of the hook to attach the "Billing same as shipping" element to the `customer_profile` inline form:

    ```php
    function commerce_shipping_commerce_inline_form_customer_profile_alter(array &$inline_form, FormStateInterface $form_state, array &$complete_form) {
        // Attach the "Billing same as shipping" element.
        $profile_field_copy = \Drupal::service('commerce_shipping.profile_field_copy');
        if ($profile_field_copy->supportsForm($inline_form, $form_state)) {
            $profile_field_copy->alterForm($inline_form, $form_state);
        }
    }
    ```

    When using the more generic form of the hook, you can use the `#inline_form` attribute of the inline form to identify a specific plugin and the `#profile_scope` attribute to identify the form mode, like this:

    ```php
    function hook_commerce_inline_form_alter(array &$inline_form, FormStateInterface $form_state, array &$complete_form) {
        /** @var \Drupal\commerce\Plugin\Commerce\InlineForm\InlineFormInterface $plugin */
        $plugin = $inline_form['#inline_form'];
        if ($plugin->getPluginId() == 'customer_profile') {
            if ($inline_form['#profile_scope'] == 'billing' && !isset($inline_form['rendered'])) {
            // Modify the billing profile when in "form" mode.
            $inline_form['address']['widget'][0]['#type'] = 'fieldset';
            // Individual address elements (e.g. "address_line1") can only
            // be accessed from an #after_build callback.
            $inline_form['address']['widget'][0]['address']['#after_build'][] = 'your_callback';
            }
        }
    }
