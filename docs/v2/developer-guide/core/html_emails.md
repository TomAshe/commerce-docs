You can find more information on how to send HTML emails with Symfony mailer on [Sending HTML emails with Symfony mailer](https://www.centarro.io/blog/replace-swift-mailer-symfony-mailer-html-email).

## Debugging emails

The Drupal.org documentation handbook has a great article for working with email in a development and testing environment: [https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/local-server-setup/managing-mail-handling-for-development-or-testing](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/local-server-setup/managing-mail-handling-for-development-or-testing)

The Drupal Commerce team recommends using [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/) for local email testing and development. [DDEV will send emails to it by default](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/usage/developer-tools/#email-capture-and-review-mailpit).
