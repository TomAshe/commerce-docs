## Who is this guide for?

This guide is primarily aimed at people _building_ Drupal Commerce sites. It assumes a level of familiarity with Drupal that will not be fully explained in the guide itself, including the knowledge to install and configure modules and to properly manage configuration in code. Elsewhere in the Drupal community and public documentation, these users are referred to as "site builders." For those who are new to Drupal code and configuration management, the guide offers a high level overview with links to resources for further reading.

Secondarily, this guide aims to support the business users of Drupal Commerce sites - those engaged in managing products, managing orders, running promotions, providing customer service, etc. Bear in mind that Drupal Commerce is _meant_ to be customized, so the documentation and screenshots this guide provides are sure to vary at places with any given site's interface. As such, it's not uncommon for site builders to provide supplemental documentation for the sites they build to identify those variances.

## What can you do with Drupal Commerce?

Drupal Commerce has been powering online stores since 2010 with use cases ranging from the very typical retail of physical products to highly complex sales of digital goods, licensed assets, or subscription services. Its feature set satisfies both B2C and B2B use cases, and its unique architecture supports targeting different _types_ of customer even within a single site via complex pricing logic, product availability rules, multiple checkout flows, etc. Furthermore, the feature set of Drupal Commerce has been extended in hundreds of different ways through [community developed extensions](https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce/ecosystem), all of which are freely available for download from Drupal's extensions directory.
